My name is <u>Raúl Marín Rodríguez</u> because my parents gave me two surnames at birth and they haven't asked me to give any of them back. At this point, I hope they never do because I'm rather fond of the two of them.

I enjoy taking things that work and making them more efficient. I am a Core Contributor of [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) and currently work at [CARTO](https://carto.com/).
